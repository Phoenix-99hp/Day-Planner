# Day-Planner

https://phoenix-99hp.github.io/Day-Planner/

This is a daily planner that encompasses hours consistent with a typical work day (9 AM - 5 PM). Entries can be written next to each time and saved to local storage via the save button on the right. The current date is displayed at the top of the planner, and entries will be color coded to reflect the current time. Time blocks that are colored gray are in the past, time blocks that are colored red are in the present, and time blocks that are colored green are in the future. Between the hours of 6 PM and 8 AM time blocks will all be colored gray until the next work day starts at 9 AM.
